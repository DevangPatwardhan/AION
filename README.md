# **Project Repository**

This repository is designed to organize the MATLAB code for flight dynamics and flight controller development. The repository is divided into structured folders for clarity and ease of navigation.

## **Repository Structure**

### **1. Flight Dynamics**  
The `FlightDynamics` folder contains all MATLAB scripts and models related to analyzing and simulating the flight dynamics of an aircraft.  

#### **Contents:**  
- **Dynamic Models**: Scripts for creating equations of motion and state-space models.  
- **Trim Analysis**: Code for trimming the aircraft under steady flight conditions.  
- **Simulation Scripts**: Time-domain simulations for various flight scenarios.  
- **Visualization**: Plotting tools for analyzing stability, control, and response.  

#### **Path:**  
```plaintext
/FlightDynamics
```

### **2. Controller**  
The `Controller` folder contains all MATLAB scripts for designing and testing flight controllers.  

#### **Contents:**  
- **PID Controllers**: Implementation of basic PID-based control for altitude, heading, and speed.  
- **State Feedback**: LQR and pole placement-based control designs.  
- **Adaptive Controllers**: Advanced techniques like adaptive or robust control.  
- **Validation**: Test scripts to validate controller performance against flight dynamics.  

#### **Path:**  
```plaintext
/Controller
```

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**  
- **MATLAB** (R2021a or later recommended)  
- Control Systems Toolbox  
- Aerospace Toolbox (optional, if models require)  

### **Usage**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```  
2. Navigate to the appropriate folder (`FlightDynamics` or `Controller`) based on your focus.  
3. Open the desired MATLAB scripts or Simulink models and run them to simulate and analyze.

## **Contribution Guidelines**

1. **Folder Structure**:  
   - Place all flight dynamics-related code in the `FlightDynamics` folder.  
   - Place all controller-related code in the `Controller` folder.  
2. **Documentation**:  
   - Include comments in your code to describe inputs, outputs, and functionality.  
   - Add new README files for sub-modules if required.  
3. **Version Control**:  
   - Create a feature branch for your updates and submit a pull request for review.
