Project Repository
This repository is designed to organize the MATLAB code for flight dynamics and flight controller development. The repository is divided into structured folders for clarity and ease of navigation.

Repository Structure
1. Flight Dynamics
The FlightDynamics folder contains all MATLAB scripts and models related to analyzing and simulating the flight dynamics of an aircraft.

Contents:
Dynamic Models: Scripts for creating equations of motion and state-space models.
Trim Analysis: Code for trimming the aircraft under steady flight conditions.
Simulation Scripts: Time-domain simulations for various flight scenarios.
Visualization: Plotting tools for analyzing stability, control, and response.

2. Controller
The Controller folder contains all MATLAB scripts for designing and testing flight controllers.

Contents:
PID Controllers: Implementation of basic PID-based control for altitude, heading, and speed.
State Feedback: LQR and pole placement-based control designs.
Adaptive Controllers: Advanced techniques like adaptive or robust control.
Validation: Test scripts to validate controller performance against flight dynamics.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
MATLAB (R2021a or later recommended)
Control Systems Toolbox
Aerospace Toolbox (optional, if models require)
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-link>  
cd <repository-folder>  
Navigate to the appropriate folder (FlightDynamics or Controller) based on your focus.
Open the desired MATLAB scripts or Simulink models and run them to simulate and analyze.
Contribution Guidelines
Folder Structure:
Place all flight dynamics-related code in the FlightDynamics folder.
Place all controller-related code in the Controller folder.
Documentation:
Include comments in your code to describe inputs, outputs, and functionality.
Add new README files for sub-modules if required.
Version Control:
Create a feature branch for your updates and submit a pull request for review.
